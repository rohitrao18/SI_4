Task Assignment and Tracking System

🚀 **Excited to Share: My Latest Project - Task Assignment & Tracking System!** 🚀

I recently completed a simple yet effective Task Assignment and Tracking System, designed to streamline task management for teams and organizations. This project aims to enhance productivity by making task assignments more transparent, ensuring accountability, and enabling managers to monitor progress and deadlines with ease.

💡 **Project Highlights:**
- **User Management:** Add and manage team members for easy task allocation.
- **Task Assignment:** Assign tasks with deadlines and descriptions, ensuring everyone knows what’s on their plate.
- **Progress Tracking:** View all tasks in a centralized view, track progress, and monitor deadlines.
- **Status Updates:** Mark tasks as “Pending” or “Complete” for real-time updates on progress.

This system is built using Python, Tkinter for the interface, and SQLite for the database, providing a lightweight, efficient solution that’s easy to use. It’s a great tool for enhancing team collaboration and transparency! 💼

Looking forward to refining and adding new features to this project. If you're interested in discussing task management solutions or have ideas for additional functionality, feel free to reach out!
